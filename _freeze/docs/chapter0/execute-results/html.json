Collaboration is encouraged for learning but not for submitting assignments.\n\n-   You are allowed to use AI tools to assist in your learning. However, ensure you fully understand the concepts and processes AI helps you with. AI tools are for learning enhancement, not for doing your work for you.\n\n-   AI tools are strictly prohibited in examinations and formally graded assignments. You should rely solely on your knowledge and understanding to complete them.\n\n**Responsible Use of Class Resources:**\n\n-   Use class resources solely for practicing and completing class assignments. Avoid using them for activities not related to this class.\n\n-   R and RStudio are open-source, but the class resources leverage a paid service and we have a limited budget for this class.\n\n-   Excessive or non-class related usage can lead to budget overruns. They will create frustrations and issue for everybody.\n\n**Monitoring and Support:**\n\n-   As your instructor, I will have access to your work. This will allow me to monitor your progress and provide help when needed.\n\n-   Keep an open line of communication. I am here to help! If you're struggling with the material or the technology, let me know sooner rather than later. Feel free to reach out via [MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aOQXwBSP8Mu8zSUEeDYJNI8HO9K3S9Gg4aNU42Y_CFPs1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=e441814b-d0ce-4ba7-b26a-8c53830b4dac&tenantId=ea873390-8c1c-4231-a799-6b5a0235b2e6) or by booking an [office hours appointment](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DrBTeamOfficeHours@mail.niu.edu/bookings/).\n\n**Respect and Integrity:**\n\n-   Be kind, respectful and polite.\n\n-   Maintain a high level of academic integrity and professionalism for your peers, me and the resources provided.\n\n-   Any form of dishonesty or disrespect will be addressed according to college policies.\n\nBy following these rules, you can ensure a productive, fair, and efficient learning environment for everyone in the class.\n\n**Focus on Learning:**\n\nMy primary focus and concern are your **learning**. I truly care that all of you understand and master all the materials that we will cover this semester. There are different components that are included in your learning evaluation:\n\n-   ***Weekly coding checkups***: demonstration of understanding/mastering the weekly materials by completing custom designed coding checkups that will walk you through a semester long and complete data analytics project.\n\n-   ***In-class participation***: willingness to understanding/mastering by asking questions and/or demonstration of understanding/mastering by answering questions/solving activities during class time.\n\n-   ***Teams participation***: willingness to understanding/mastering by asking questions and/or demonstration of understanding/mastering by answering questions/solving activities on the MS Teams class channel.\n\n-   ***Professionalism***: attitude towards learning (e.g., being on time, staying engaged, paying attention, being respectful etc.)\n\n-   ***Others***: participation to other learning enhancement initiatives (e.g., completing surveys, responding to polls etc.)\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe following sections of our book R for Data Science( [first portion of the course book](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) ) are included in the first week:\n\n-   [Introduction](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro)\n\n### Link to other resources\n\n-   Internal help: [posit support](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us)\n\n-   External help: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=rstudio&s=25d8522e-3191-4bf2-ae3b-ccad762aeca9)\n\n-   Additional materials: [posit resources](https://posit.co/resources/)\n\n-   Cheat Sheets: [posit cheat sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)\n\nWhile I use the book as a reference the materials provided to you are custom made and include more activities and resources. If you understand the materials covered in this document there is no need to refer to other sources. If you have any troubles with the materials don't hesitate to contact me or check the above sources.\n\n### Installing & Loading packages\n\n-   If you install R & RStudio on your own machine it is critical that you install all the required packages. You will need to install them be able to use functions and datasets they contain. This is a one time task unless you uninstall R & RStudio or you change your computer.\n\n-   Loading packages is also a critical task and it is more repetitive. Every time you open a new RStudio session you will need to load the packages using the *library* function. Failing to do so will incur in the most common errors among beginners (e.g., function not found or object not found)\n\n-   **NB in this class we have a dynamic book & materials in which I take care of all the boring things for you so that you just focus on LEARNING ;-)**\n\nOk great! This should be enough to start your journey. See you for more in the next chapter!\n",
