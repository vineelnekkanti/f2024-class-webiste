# Fall 2024 Academic Website for "Predictive Business Analytics using R"

This is a limited functionality version of the website I actually built. Many of the features were taken off this version, as I have maintain code confidentiality. This is to demo my work and my experience using R and its packages, Quarto, Shiny and others.
